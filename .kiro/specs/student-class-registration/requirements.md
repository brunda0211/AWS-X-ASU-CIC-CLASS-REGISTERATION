# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a student class registration system built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, AWS DynamoDB, and NextAuth.js. The system will allow students to register for accounts, authenticate, browse available classes, and enroll in courses while providing administrators with management capabilities.
